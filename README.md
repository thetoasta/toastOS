# toastOS
hi! welcome to toastOS, a open source os that isn't the best but also is pretty unique and cool
## Building
use the included build-mac.sh file if you're on mac. this will be a os that you can only build on unix/darwin based systems.
linux, use build-mac.sh but if there is a error just use isntall-requirements.sh.
## Contributing
please contribute i need it, you need it, we all need it.
## Features
not much of a os yet.
